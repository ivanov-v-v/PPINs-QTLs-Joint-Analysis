#Foss2007.txt:
A file from Zia Khan (June 2010) with protein abundance data. 574 columns. (Let's start numeration from 0.) Line 0: column names. Columns 0-16: additional data for a line. Column 1: protein name. Columns 17-464: values from 2 parents and 107 progeny, 10 replicates for each parent and 4 replicates for each progeny. Columns 17-444: progeny values. Columns 445-454: BY parent. Columns 455-464: RM parents. Columns 465-574: median values, for each progeny and for each parent. Columns 465-571: progeny median values. Column 572: BY median value. Column 573: RM median value.

##GDS1115.soft:
Genetic variation in gene expression among parents and progenies
Expression profiling of parental strains and haploid progenies from a cross of strain BY4716 and the wild wine strain RM11-1a. Results used to find linkage between gene expression levels, which are treated as quantitative traits, and genetic markers.

##GDS1116.soft:
The same thing, but with dye-swap arrays.

##phenotype_data.txt:
Genome annotation with 2820 genetic markers for budding yeast strains BY and RM and their progeny ("Genetic basis of proteome variation in yeast" (2007, Nature Genetics, Kruglyak Lab)), 123 genotypes in total
