Updated readme from July 28, 2017


Foss2007.txt :

a file from Zia Khan (June 2010) with protein abundance data. 574 columns. (Let's start numeration from 0.) Line 0: column names. Columns 0-16: additional data for a line. Column 1: protein name. Columns 17-464: values from 2 parents and 107 progeny, 10 replicates for each parent and 4 replicates for each progeny. Columns 17-444: progeny values. Columns 445-454: BY parent. Columns 455-464: RM parents. Columns 465-574: median values, for each progeny and for each parent. Columns 465-571: progeny median values. Column 572: BY median value. Column 573: RM median value.

Update: this file is actually a newer version from February 2011, with ~1300 proteins analyzed.


Zia_Khan_email_Re_ 2d protein QTL LOD plots?.rtf:

Email correspondence with Zia regarding the his processing of Foss2007 mass spec data (his better algorithm applied to the same data allowed to get estimates for many more proteins than in the original Foss2007 paper). He shared with me the above data.


GDS1115.soft and GDS1116.soft: 

Expression data (can be obtained again from GEO using the accession numbers GDS1115 and GDS1116) from Brem et al. 2005 paper.


josh_formatted_genotypes.txt.tar.gz:

File from Joshua Bloom with phenotypes of yeast segregants.


Joshua_Bloom_email_Re_ genetic markers for yeast segregants.rtfd:

Email correspondence with Joshua Bloom regarding the genotypes data above.



readme.txt:

My older readme describing some of the data sets. Many of them are in Python pickle format and dependent on some of my old code, so I don't include it here. We can think of restoring them if needed, but theoretically the above data plus some more recent public data should be enough to reproduce.
